Visualization of Center for American Progress BCRA Medicaid Losses.
This is a project in R using the geofacet package to visualize data across states. I use data from the Center for American Progress, published June 26, 2017, on projected Medicaid coverage losses under BCRA by insurance type. I matched by state with 2013 Medicaid enrollment numbers from MACPAC to determine the percentage, by coverage type, that those losses would represent (note: CAP used the 2013 MACPAC enrollment data in their projections, so I felt it appropriate to use the same numbers here). Links to all content, including a google sheet with all of the data, can be found in the R script in the header.
